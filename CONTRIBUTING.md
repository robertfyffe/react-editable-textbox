### Commit Process

When making a commit, you must use `npm run commit` or `yarn run commit`.
This will provide a workflow to create consistent commit messages.

### Docs

Please update the README with any changes, the code and docs should
always be in sync.

### Development

- `yarn start` runs the dev server to run/develop examples
- `yarn test` will run linting.

### Build

Please do not include the output of `scripts/build` in your commits, we
only do this when we release. (Also, you probably don't need to build
anyway unless you are fixing something around our global build.)
